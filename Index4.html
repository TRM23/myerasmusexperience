                After a hearty breakfast, we set off for Krakow, our next stop being the Manggha Museum, a wonderful museum of Japanese art. Manggha is a unique museum in Poland, as it is the only one dedicated to collecting paintings inspired by Japanese art, with a particular focus on works representing Polish Japonism.We were delighted to see a large selection of prints and posters, with the most valuable works being by the talented Toshihiro Hamano.Next, we visited the beautiful Wawel Castle Cathedral. There, we were greeted by the Wawel dragon, a famous dragon from Polish folklore, which was so cool!After the audio guide of Wawel Cathedral, where we had a chance to see with our own eyes the Sigismund Bell, which is considered the national symbol of Poland, we also visited the museum there. There, we had a chance to see different objects used by the papacy in Poland throughout the ages. Then, we went to the Sukiennice Art Museum, where we saw the largest permanent exhibition of Polish painting and sculpture from the 19th century.

                After we finished visiting the museums suggested by our coordinating teachers, we all went for lunch. Then we had an hour to explore the centre of Krak√≥w, where we had the opportunity to hear the trumpet blowing from the Town Hall Tower. In the past, this was an alert call to warn its inhabitants of any danger and also marked the opening and closing of the city gates.There, I noticed a stuffed animal that I fell in love with at first sight: a giant goose! I named it Biedronka, after the supermarket I had been to the day before, because it stuck in my mind, despite the fact that "biedronka" in Polish means "ladybug".Then we went back to the hotel where we had dinner and got ready for the next day.
