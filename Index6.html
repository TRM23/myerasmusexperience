                On Thursday, we went back to school, which was so lovely! We attended different classes that focused on practical applications, which we really enjoyed. The first lesson was a physics lesson on Newton's and Pascal's laws, and the students did different experiments to demonstrate these laws. One example was the comparison between a boiled and an unboiled egg, which was really interesting! If you spin both eggs at the same time, you'll notice that one spins faster than the other. To tell which is which, you need to know Newton's law of motion, which states that the faster one egg spins, the less it wants to change. In our case, the white of the uncooked egg doesn't want to change, so the faster one egg spins is the boiled egg. Then, in our second class, we had biology, where we used microscopes to take a look at the tissues of different vegetables and flat vegetables, like onions and peppers.Next, we had Polish class, where we played games to learn about Polish culture and history, as well as doing exercises to improve our Polish language skills. We also had physical education, where we learned to play table tennis, which was great fun.Finally, we had drawing class, where we had the opportunity to paint traditional Polish patterns on wooden boxes and anything else we could think of.

                After class, we went to a tennis court where we met a coach, and under his guidance, we learned how to hold the tennis racket correctly, as well as how to hit the tennis ball.Then, we went to Siepraw Town Hall, where Mr. Mayor Pitala gave us a presentation about his village. We learned so much about this super developed village full of opportunities and attractions.
