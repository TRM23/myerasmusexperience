            <div id="title">21 April 2024: The trip - not as bad as imagined!</div>

                We set off on Sunday morning, April 21st, at 8:30 AM. I got on the minibus and grabbed a seat next to my friend Paula. Unlike everyone else, I had brought a pillow and a blanket—past experiences taught me that a long and tiring journey was ahead. I had also packed a book, The Shack by William P. Young, hoping to finish it during these six days.

                However, my plans quickly changed because Paula and I started chatting about everything and nothing, completely losing track of time. At one point, we watched the first episode of Breaking Bad, and after that, we decided to get some sleep. We made a few stops along the way to stretch our legs.

                Right before crossing into Poland, it felt like time had stood still. But once we entered, the remaining three hours of our trip flew by, thanks to the breathtaking scenery. We were all pretty surprised to see snow in the middle of April, but honestly, none of us minded!

                When we finally arrived at our hotel, Hotel Dobczyce, I ended up sharing a room with Paula, Maria, and Bianca. I was completely exhausted, but with the little energy I had left, I joined the others for dinner at 8 PM. At first, I wasn’t too excited about Polish cuisine, but over time, I realized that the flavors were unique and absolutely delicious!
