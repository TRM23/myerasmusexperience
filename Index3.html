            <div id="title">22 April 2024: First day impressions</div>
            <div class="text">
                On Monday morning we went to our host school, Szko≈Ça Podstawowa w zakliczynie, where we were welcomed by the headmistress. We were then taken to a classroom where two seventh graders, Karolina and Adrian, gave a presentation about the education system in Poland. After the students answered our questions, some of their eighth grade classmates took their place to give us a tour of the school, where we saw not only the classrooms but also the teaching materials used during class time. Then, as it was Earth Day, the students from the school performed a short sketch about the impact we have on the environment and how our actions can affect it. Although the children spoke in Polish, we were each given a small booklet with the whole sketch translated into English so that we could follow along. Afterwards, the secretary of Dobczyce Town Hall gave a presentation about the town, focusing on its rich fauna. After lunch in the school canteen, some students dressed in local costumes performed a traditional dance for us to learn. It was a unique and funny experience, we all had a great time and I made friends with a lot of children!
